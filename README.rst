Gameserver Response Parser
==========================

** this is work in progress **

This is a python package which can parse several formats of responses for queries
of different gameservers.

E.g. this can parse the response of the A2S_Info query a SRCDS gameserver sends.

currently supported:

- SRCDS
- GoldSource
- Quake3
- Gamespy
- Gamespy 2
